# PVRApp
I have commenced work on developing a PVR (movie theater chain) application using Scratch, a visual programming platform. To enhance security and reliability, the project incorporates the Stripe feature for processing payments securely.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
Ticket Booking: The core functionality of the PVR app is to facilitate movie ticket reservations. Users will have the ability to browse through available movie listings, select showtimes, and book tickets for their preferred films.

User-Friendly Interface: The app will feature an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed to enhance the user experience. This includes easy navigation, clear movie information, and a seamless booking process.

Secure Payments: In order to ensure the security of users' financial transactions, the app will integrate the Stripe feature. This will allow users to make payments with confidence, knowing that their sensitive information is being handled securely.

𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:
React Native, Stripe API
